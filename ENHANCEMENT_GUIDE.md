## 📊 Sample Output

### Before Enhancement
```mdx

  tiers={{
    "S": [
      { 
        name: "Logitech G Pro X Superlight", 
        review: "Great mouse",
        link: "https://amzn.to/logitech-pro-superlight"
      }

  }}
/>
```

    "S": [
      { 
        name: "Logitech G Pro X Superlight", 
        review: "Ultra-lightweight wireless gaming mouse preferred by esports professionals. Exceptional sensor accuracy and build quality with 70-hour battery life.",
        link: "https://amzn.to/logitech-pro-superlight",
        image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615CE5wL-tL.jpg",
        imageSource: "serpapi_retail"
      }
    ]
  }}
/>
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Order of Operations
1. **Images First**: Run image enhancement before reviews to ensure complete product data
2. **Reviews Second**: AI can generate better reviews when it has access to complete product information
3. **Review Changes**: Always review AI-generated content before committing

### Quality Control
- **Image Sources**: Prefer `serpapi_retail` (Amazon, official sites) over `unsplash` 
- **Review Length**: Aim for 20-40 words per review for optimal SEO and readability
- **Category Accuracy**: Ensure file names/titles clearly indicate product category for better AI reviews

### Performance Tips
- **Batch Processing**: Use batch mode for multiple files to process efficiently
- **API Limits**: Scripts include 1-second delays between API calls to respect rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Scripts continue processing other products if one fails

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"SERPAPI_KEY not found"**
- Add your SerpAPI key to `.env` file
- Ensure environment variables are loaded in production

**"No TierList component found"**
- Check MDX file format matches expected structure
- Ensure `<TierList tiers={{...}} />` syntax is correct

**"Invalid review generated"**  
- Check OpenAI API key and credits
- Review may be too short/long - manual adjustment may be needed

**Rate limiting errors**
- Scripts include delays, but you may need to increase them for large batches
- Consider processing files in smaller groups

## 📈 Monitoring Enhancement

### Check Enhancement Status
```bash
# See which files need enhancement
grep -r "review.*Great\|Good\|Solid" src/content/tierlists/
grep -r "image.*\"\"" src/content/tierlists/

# Count enhanced vs total products
node scripts/validate-images.mjs  # Shows image coverage statistics
```

### Track Enhancement History
```bash
# See recent enhancements in git
git log --oneline --grep="Enhanced\|enhanced"

# Compare before/after
git diff HEAD~1 src/content/tierlists/
```

This automation ensures your tierlists always have high-quality images and informative reviews without manual effort!
