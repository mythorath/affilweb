## Why These Rankings?

This demo tierlist showcases various affiliate link scenarios:
- **Empty links** that need Amazon search URLs
- **Amazon links without affiliate tags** that need our tag added
- **Amazon links with wrong tags** that need tag correction  
- **Amazon links with correct tags** that should be preserved
- **Non-Amazon links** that should be replaced with Amazon search
- **Missing links** that need to be generated

The enhancement script will automatically fix all these scenarios while preserving the MDX formatting.
